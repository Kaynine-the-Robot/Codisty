# Codisty README

Welcome to Codisty!

To download the latest build you will need to pull the project manually, as the large files in the project needs git LFS in order to get them

The easiest way to do this is to use the GitHub Desktop Client (should come with git LFS):
  - If you do not have the client, you must install it: https://desktop.github.com/
  - Add a new reposity with the "Clone repository" option, choose an empty folder to download it to
  - This should download the project including the large files, this may take a minute

If downloading the desktop client is not possible the alternative is to install git and git LFS
  - Follow the links below and the instructions to install
  - https://git-scm.com/downloads
  - https://git-lfs.com/
  - Open git bash and navigate to an empty folder with it using the cd command
  - Use the git clone command followed by the url https://github.com/Kaynine-the-Robot/Codisty.git
  - This should download the repo with the large files, but I have not tested it
