# Codisty README

Welcome to Codisty!

To download the latest build you will need to pull the project manually, as the large files in the project needs git LFS in order to get them

The easiest way to do this is to use the GitHub Desktop Client:
  - If you do not have the client, you must install it: https://desktop.github.com/
  - Add a new reposity with the "Clone repository" option, choose an empty folder to download it to
  - This should download the project including the large files, this may take a minute

If downloading the desktop client is not possible the alternative is to install git
